## üß© OEM Folder Integration

The script can generate a `$OEM$` structure for automated activation during Windows installation.  
When placed in your Windows installation media, activation runs right after setup.

**Path structure:**
```

$OEM$$$\Setup\Scripts\MAS_AIO.cmd
$OEM$$$\Setup\Scripts\SetupComplete.cmd

```

This ensures the activation script triggers after setup completion.

## üîß Troubleshooting

If any errors occur, the script automatically displays diagnostic messages and links, such as:

- `fix_service` ‚Äî Repair Null service or dependencies  
- `fix_powershell` ‚Äî Enable PowerShell FullLanguage mode  
- `troubleshoot` ‚Äî Common issues and general repair guide  
- `remove_malware` ‚Äî Remove known malware activators  
- `licensing-servers-issue` ‚Äî Fix blocked activation endpoints  

You can also manually open the **Troubleshoot** option from the main menu.
